## 🔔 Payment Reminder System

### How It Works

**Calculation Logic**:
1. Get all active rentals (confirmed status)
2. Calculate months since rental start
3. Determine next payment date (monthly cycle)
4. Check if payment is within 30 days
5. Mark as urgent if 7 days or less

**Example**:
```
Rental Start: Sept 15, 2025
Today: Oct 12, 2025
Months Since Start: 0
Next Payment: Oct 15, 2025
Days Until Payment: 3
Status: URGENT (Red Alert)
```

**Display**:
- Urgent (0-7 days): Red background, alert icon
- Upcoming (8-30 days): Yellow background, clock icon
- Property title and address
- Payment amount
- Due date
- Days remaining
