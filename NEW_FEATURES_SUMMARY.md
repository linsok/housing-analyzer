## ✅ Feature 4: Owner Property Approval System

### How It Works:

#### When Owner Creates Account:
1. Owner registers with role "owner"
2. Account is created with `verification_status='pending'`
3. Owner can login but properties need approval

#### Admin Approval Process:
1. **Admin Dashboard** shows "Pending User Verifications"
2. Admin sees:
   - Owner name and email
   - Role badge
   - ID document (if uploaded)
3. Admin can:
   - ✅ **Approve** - Sets `verification_status='verified'`
   - ❌ **Reject** - Sets `verification_status='rejected'`

#### After Approval:
- Verified owners can list properties
- Properties from verified owners get priority
- Badge shows "Verified Owner" status

### Where to Manage:
- **Admin Dashboard** → "Pending User Verifications" section
- Shows count badge with number of pending verifications
- Real-time updates after approval/rejection
